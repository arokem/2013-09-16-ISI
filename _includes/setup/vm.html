  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>
  
  <p>
    Installation issues can and do happen. To ensure that you
    can continue to participate in a lesson even if one of your
    software programs fails, we provide a Linux virtual machine
    that contains all the necessary software
    pre-installed. Please install Virtual Box from
    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">here</a> for your OS.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the first day we will do a walkthrough of how to setup and launch the bootcamp VM through Virtual Box.
