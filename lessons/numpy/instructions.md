## Typed Arrays with Numpy

In this section, we will work out of the IPython notebook.  Please move to the
`2013-09-16-ISI/lessons/numpy` directory and type `ipython notebook` from the
commandline.  This will start the ipython notebook server and open a web browser
showing the ipython notebook dashboard.
