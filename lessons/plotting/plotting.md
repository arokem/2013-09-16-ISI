## Plotting with Matplotlib

In this section, we will work out of the IPython notebook.  Please move to the
`2013-09-16-ISI/lessons/plotting` directory and type `ipython notebook` from the
commandline.  This will start the ipython notebook server and open a web browser
showing the ipython notebook dashboard.
